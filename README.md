# Snake Client Project

Snake is a popular old school game where the player maneuvers a dot and grows it by ‘eating’ pieces of food. As it moves and eats, it grows and grows. The goal is to become as big as possible without bumping into the side walls, or itself, or else it dies!

Currently this is a single-player game, but will be updated at the end of this week to be multiplayer!

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from here.
