# Snake Client Project 🐍🐍🐍

Snake is a popular old school game where the player maneuvers a dot and grows it by ‘eating’ pieces of food. As it moves and eats, it grows and grows. The goal is to become as big as possible without bumping into the side walls, or itself, or else it dies!

Currently this is a single-player game, but will be updated at the end of this week to be multiplayer!

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from here. 

## Features

When you connect, you will spawn in a random location and be labelled with the best initials possible - CL.
This project supports movement in the 4 directions: up, down, left, and right using keys w, s, a, and d, respectively.
You can also taunt using 1, 2, and 3!
Press ctrl + c to exit the game.

## Getting Started

- Follow steps inside the [snek server repo](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/snek-multiplayer) to run the server side
- Run the development snake client using the `node play.js` command
- Enjoy!
